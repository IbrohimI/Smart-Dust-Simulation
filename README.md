# Smart-Dust-Simulation

This program simulates the movement of the object in the field. Also, the field will have randomly placed sensors(the color of which will change upon coming or distancing object) and Flechettes. Sensors will send their signal to Flechettes. Each Flechette can read signal of sensors only in their circular range. Than, Flechettes will send the accumulated signal to the data base. In the data base, depending on how strong the overall signals are, it will identify what the object was (human, vehicle, plane, etc.).
Along with your favorite IDE, gnuplot package should be installed in the local PC.
The program will generate a set of figures. The figures are merged to create an animation in gifmaker.com
